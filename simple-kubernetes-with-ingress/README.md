# Starting working with kubernetes and ingress 

This just serves as an example of how to work with ingress on a local kubernetes.

Make sure your are in the right place in your file system, switch to the `simple-kubernetes-with-ingress`folder
 
## Create the cluster
We will use a kind cluster in this excercise, because it is easy to construct on your local machine and very easy to tear down as well.
Kind builds on docker and thus you should have docker installed an running.

```console
kind create cluster --name ingress --config=config.yaml
```

## Install ingress controller

A Kubernetes ingress controller is a reverse-proxy or layer 7 load balancer, that is capable of handling network traffic
from outside of the cluster and route it to the pods inside of the cluster. Kubernetes contains an ingress resource type
to specify ingress configuration, but no ingress controllers are installed by default, as they may be specific for the
infrastructures. Here we are running on a local machine and we will use nginx as ingress controller for this workshop example.

To see what is actually contained in the definition of an ingress controller and install it:

```console
cat ingress-controller.yaml 
kubectl create -f ./ingress-controller.yaml
```

Wait for deployment to be ready.

```console
kubectl wait pod -n ingress-nginx -l app.kubernetes.io/name=ingress-nginx,app.kubernetes.io/component=controller --for condition=Ready  --timeout=45s
```

In the remaining parts of the workshop we will just use the default namespace for making it easier to write the commands you need to write.

## Install the applications

Take a look at the applications, which are basically two deployments with one replica (pod) each and one deployment with 4 replicas.

```console
cat deployments.yaml 
```

Progess to install these two application as:

```console
kubectl create -f ./deployments.yaml
```

## Install the services for the applications

Take a look at the services, which are in front of the applications.

```console
cat services.yaml 
```

Then install the services.

```console
kubectl create -f ./services.yaml
```

## Install the ingress for the services
Take a look at the local ingress definition for the services, where you will find 3 definitions. Two of these for `foo` and `bar` and one to use in a while called `baz`.

```console
cat ingress.yaml 
```
Lets us install the ingress

```console
kubectl create -f ./ingress.yaml
```

## Accessing the Application
Now when you access the application it is possible to use the Ingress Controller and the Ingress to select between the two applications through the two services:

To get the `hello-bar` application
```console
curl localhost/hello-bar/hostname
```
which takes you through the `hello-ingress` ingress to the `hello-bar-service` service to the `hello-bar-app` pod.

To get the `hello-foo` application
```console
curl localhost/hello-foo/hostname
```
which takes you through the `hello-ingress` ingress to the `hello-foo-service` service to the `hello-foo-app` pod

To get the `hello-baz` application 
```console
curl localhost/hello-baz/hostname
```

which takes you through the `hello-ingress` ingress through the `hello-baz-service` service to the `hello-baz-app` pods. The
`hello-baz-app` deployment contains 4 replicas. Try calling the hello-baz application several times using:

```console
curl localhost/hello-baz/hostname
```

and see that it returns different names, which informs you that traffic is sent to different pods, i.e., the loadbalancing
in the `baz` service balances across the pods. 

This means you now have an application deployed across "nodes" and you receive traffic from "outside" the cluster and that traffic is balancede across "nodes" into one of the instances of the application.
You can see that by examininig the names of the pods responding and knowing how these are distributed across "nodes" in the cluster:

```console
kubectl get pods -o wide
```

Or if you want to see the baz app isolated:

```console
kubectl get pods -o wide | grep baz
````

## Virtual Hosting

The above examples exposes the applications on the same hostname `localhost` routing the traffic based on the path of the
http request (hello-foo, hello-bar, hello-baz). The same ingress controller can also distinguish requests based on the
requested hostname. There is an example of this in the `multiple-domains` folder - take a look at the ingress resource.

```console
cat multiple-domains/ingress.yaml
```

and apply the specification:

```console
kubectl apply -f ./multiple-domains/ingress.yaml
```

Now check the response when calling using different hostnames:

```console
curl foo-127-0-0-1.nip.io/hostname
curl bar-127-0-0-1.nip.io/hostname
curl baz-127-0-0-1.nip.io/hostname
```

_Note_ the three domains (foo-127-0-0-1.nip.io, foo-127-0-0-1.nip.io, foo-127-0-0-1.nip.io) all resolve to `127.0.0.1` (i.e., localhost) but the ingress controller will route based on the http host header.

# Workshop Intentions
The intentions of this workshop was to convey som initial knowledge on working with kubernetes in a very simple way, the aim being to leave you with a bit of knowledge that will hopefully ignite your interest in kubernetes, as it is possible to work with it on your local machine. 

Please tell us your feedback for us to be able to make a better job the next time, so please:
- what did you find hard in the workshop?
- what did you find tom easy in the workshop?
- how do you percieve that the workshop will help you starting to get aquinted with kubernetes going forward?
- did it ignite your interest for cloud native and kubernetes?
- what can we improve on the:
  - introductory part?
  - the practice part?
  - the notes and accompanying information?

# Thank you
If you want to know more about Cloud Native and want to get together with other people sharing the desire to work with Cloud Native, Cloud Native Aalborg, Netic,kubernetes ot about the Secure Cloud Stack, please get in touch with us either in Netic, on Slack via Cloud Native Nordics or meet us in the Cloud Native Aalborg (or other cities) Meetups, or drop by for a cup of coffee (please write beforehand as we would like to be there on location).

## Peace
